# turn.rb Pseudocode

## Goal: 
    - Determine what type of data structure would be the best fit to approach the turn.rb section of the War or Peace project.
  
    - Structures up for comparison are: Either creating a class file of their own and running spec files for each turn type individually, or creating hashes within one Type class for each turn type.
      
## Approach:
    - When first learing about hashes, I only remember seeing the :symbol and local variables being used for key => value pair keys, and then a various data type used for the vaules. If any of the data within the hash solution is to be dynamic, I may need to use @instance_variables for either key or value elements of the hash.
