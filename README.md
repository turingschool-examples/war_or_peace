### Mentors' Assistance

I met with my mentor once and my rock twice to help with this project. Additionally, I met up with an old developer colleague/friend for guidance and advisement as well. I also met with student support.

When I met with my mentor, we went over enumerables and arrays. I received much help from him on my Deck class.

With my rock, we discussed the Turn class. He helped me make sure that I had sufficient tests for the Turn class, since it contains the most methods of all the classes in the project.

My friend was able to also help me with my Turn class a lot. He was the one to suggest creating more shorter methods rather than have one long method. So I followed his suggestion and tried to implement this idea a few times throughout the project. I'm not sure if it's Ruby standard to do things this way, but he knows many, many programming languages and has been doing coding since 1985, so I figure he knows what he's talking about.

### Questions

- What worked well for me in this project?
During this project, I did way better research than previous projects. I was able to find answers quicker and find the exact information I was looking for. Another thing that went well was my testing I think. There were a few hang-ups, but I was able to write a test & the code & it worked right away. What a feeling! I'm also starting to feel like I can do this, which is great too. I've also found that writing the tests first is way better and easier than trying to write the code first. It gives direction and writing the tests for this project was pretty straightforward.
- What didn't work so well - ie. what changes will I implement for my next project?
I wasn't able to make it through Iteration 3, I didn't have time. The first two iterations took me a long time to get through, especially the Turn class. Fortunately, I was able to get plenty of help with this project, but I think next time I would seek out even more. As Cydnee from student support said, "It takes a village at Turing." She's right. So, I'd get even more help and pester my mentors. :)
- What piece of code am I the most proud of?
My Turn class. The whole thing. I still can't believe I wrote all that code and it works. I'm also pretty proud of my Deck class. It took me a very long time to figure out the #percent_high_ranking, especially with the correct formatting of the percentage. That one required quite a bit of digging and researching, but I got it eventually.
