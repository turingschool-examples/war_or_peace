## War or Peace

This is the repo for Taylor Varoglu's BE Mod1 **War or Peace** project.


### Project Requirements

1. [x] [Iteration 1](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/war_or_peace/iteration1)

2. [x] [Iteration 2](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/war_or_peace/iteration2)

3. [x] [Iteration 3](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/war_or_peace/iteration3)

4. [x] [Iteration 4](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/war_or_peace/iteration4)



#### Results

1. `testing output`
    - Note, `greet` and `start` methods in `Game` class return strings, and therefore print intended terminal outputs during a `spec` run.
    - Note, even with a limited game run test (deck of 6 cards), the game can still result in a draw.

2. `production output`
    - Executed via the `runner` file in the `root` directory.  Iteration 4 (dynamic card generator) was built during Iteration 3, to avoid manual hard-coding a deck of cards. This method is tested in the corresponding `spec` file for the `Game` class.
